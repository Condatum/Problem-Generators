𝐃𝐚𝐨𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐟𝐢𝐭 is an interactive clothing system  capable of real time data management,
designed to help users store, organize, and assemble outfits using a structured, category-based approach.
At its core, the application manages garments in real time, allowing users to add, remove, browse, and combine clothing items with ease.

The wardrobe is divided into three primary garment categories:
- Top
- Bottom
- Footwear

Each clothing item in 𝐃𝐚𝐨𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐟𝐢𝐭 is represented as a detailed object containing a unique ID, name, and image.
The system maintains consistent organization across its categories, allowing users to quickly locate and visually explore items within their digital collection. 
To support both uniform behavior and future scalability, the application utilizes an object-oriented structure in which every clothing type extends from an abstract base class.

A dedicated Wardrobe Manager oversees item storage and category filtering, ensuring smooth management of the user’s collection. Complementing this is the Outfit Builder, which enables users to assemble complete looks by selecting one item from each category.

The GUI interface, built with Java Swing, provides intuitive interaction through item dialogs, visual previews, and robust file persistence, allowing wardrobe data to be saved and reloaded across sessions. These currently implemented features form the foundation of a more advanced wardrobe management system that will continue to expand as development progresses.
