The Digital Wardrobe is an interactive clothing system  capable of real time data management,
designed to help users store, organize, and assemble outfits using a structured, category-based approach.
At its core, the application manages garments in real time, allowing users to add, remove, browse, and combine clothing items with ease.

Note: This project is still in development.
More features and improvements will continue to be added.

The wardrobe is divided into three primary garment categories:
- Top
- Bottom
- Footwear

Each clothing item is represented as an object with unique details such as an ID, name, and image. 
The system ensures consistent organization through these categories, helping users quickly locate and visualize pieces in their digital collection. 
In addition, the system incorporates an object-oriented structure where each clothing type extends from an abstract base class, allowing consistent behavior across all items while supporting future expansion.
A dedicated Wardrobe manager handles item storage and category filtering, while an Outfit builder lets users assemble complete looks by selecting one item from each category. 
The GUI interface, built with Java Swing, enables intuitive interaction through item dialogs, visual previews, and file persistence so that wardrobe data can be saved and reloaded across sessions.
These currently implemented features form the foundation of a more advanced wardrobe management system that will continue to grow as development progresses.
